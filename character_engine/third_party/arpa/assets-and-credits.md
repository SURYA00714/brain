# Assets & credits

This document covers third-party character, animation, and environment assets shipped with AVATAR. **AVATAR** (this software) is MIT-licensed; **bundled media retain their original rights holders’ terms**.

**Machine-readable inventory:** [`assets-manifest.yml`](assets-manifest.yml) — every bundled VRM, VRMA, environment GIF, derived thumbnail, installer branding asset, and documentation screenshot, with paths, licenses, credit lines, and audit status. Validated in CI via `npm test` in `avatar/`.

## Contact for rights / takedown

If you are a rights holder and believe any bundled asset should be removed or attributed differently, contact:

**input@arpacorp.net**

We will respond and remove or replace the asset promptly.

## VRM characters

| Item | Notes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Source | Created / customized in [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio) and [VRoid Hub](https://hub.vroid.com/) |
| Cost | **Free only** — no paid VRoid / BOOTH models, wearables, hair, clothes, or textures are used in this repository |
| Status | Sample files named `avatar1.vrm`, `avatar2.vrm`, `avatar3.vrm` for testing |

Users who ship their own builds **must** use only assets they have rights to, and must obey each creator’s BOOTH / VRoid Hub terms of use (credit, redistribution, commercial use, streaming, etc.). Policies vary per item — always check the product page.

### VRoid Hub linked characters (optional)

When a user connects their own Hub OAuth app, AVATAR may load characters through
VRoid Hub’s licensed download flow. Those bytes stay **in memory for the
session only** and are not redistributed as repo assets. Hearted models show
their Hub conditions of use in-app before selection. See
[VRoid Hub connection](vroid-hub.md).

### Your own files (self-serve)

Beyond bundled samples, desktop users can point **Settings → Directories** at local folders (`.vrm` avatars; `.vrma` animations; `.gif` / `.png` / `.jpg` / `.jpeg` environments) or connect **VRoid Hub**. You are responsible for rights to any files or Hub characters you load. Guides: [Avatars](avatars.md) · [VRMA animations](animations/vrma.md) · [Environments](environments.md) · [Using the app](using-the-app.md).
